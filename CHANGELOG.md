# Flow — CHANGELOG

Canonical infrastructure releases for `CandidDan/flow`. Each entry = one advance of the `v1` alias.
Policy: `docs/flow-versioning-policy.md` (immutable `vX.Y.Z` + a moving `vX` alias, advanced only
after a canary passes). Note any **caller action** required (a caller change is a MAJOR bump).

## Unreleased

_(next changes accumulate here until the alias is advanced)_

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-03 (pending tag + canary)

- **`flow-state` resolver added** (`.flow/bin/flow-state.mjs` + tests) — the trusted, on-demand
  answer to "what's the real state of this task?". Reads task state from **`origin/main`** (the one
  authoritative, `flow-fetch`-fresh layer — never the stale working tree or sandbox clone) and, when
  `gh` is available, reconciles each task against its PR (open → `in_review`, merged → `done`, closed
  → back to `ready`), surfacing any store-vs-PR **disagreement** as a writeback-lag signal. Read-only:
  never writes a task, commits, or opens a PR. Closes the loop that forced Chrome trips + asking the
  human for status. Usage: `node .flow/bin/flow-state.mjs [ID] [--json] [--no-pr] [--fetch]`.
  [caller action: none — `.flow/bin` rides the version + `flow-sync`, no per-repo caller change]
- Fixes a frontmatter-parse bug shared with the other bin readers: a `#` inside a value (e.g.
  `issue: "#157"`) was truncated as a comment. `flow-state`'s parser strips only a whitespace-
  preceded ` # comment` (the YAML rule), so hash-bearing values survive.

## v1.x — 2026-06 (backfill — reconstruct exact versions from tags)

The reusable-workflow era. Reconstruct precise `vX.Y.Z` boundaries from git tags; these are the
notable changes that shipped under `v1` during the initial reconciliation:

- **Reusable workflows + thin callers.** Every `flow-*` workflow split into a canonical reusable
  (`_flow-*.yml`) called by a 3-line per-repo caller. Repos now *reference* canonical, not copy it.
- **flow-open-pr / flow-recover / flow-sync** added (auto-open-PR non-draft; stranded-task recovery;
  the adopt mechanism).
- **flow-doctor** reconciled: source_roots floor + touches-overlap + uncommitted-task guard.
- **flow-review**: `--max-turns 25 → 80` + `bypassPermissions` (reviewer couldn't run its read
  commands); `allowed_bots: *` so bot-opened PRs get reviewed.
- **CALLER FIX (major-flavoured):** thin callers for `flow-status` / `flow-done` / `flow-recover` /
  `flow-open-pr` / `flow-sync` were missing `permissions:`, so their reusables failed at startup
  ("requesting contents: write, only allowed contents: read"). Fixed in the template; **existing
  repos must re-sync their callers** (this is why caller changes are MAJOR — they don't ride `@v1`).
